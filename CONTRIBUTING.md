###### Contributing to 'Shout Out'

---

Thank you for supporting us and our project ‘Shout Out’. This is our project on Opensource Software development class, and our second project on our own. If this project fits on yours, you would need help as opensource developers. We tried to summarize our works we’ve done before, but it was not easy to make it. Reading this document will help you save time and work efficiently with the developers and other contributors.


##### Development Ideology

---

We pursue, 

1. The development which communicates each other.

2. The development which shares ‘Think’ free without constraint each other.

3. The development which shares values and interest fields each other.
