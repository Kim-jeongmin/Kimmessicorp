# Contributing to 'Shout Out'



Thank you for supporting us and our project ‘Shout Out’. This is our project on Opensource Software development class, and our second project on our own. If this project fits on yours, you would need help as opensource developers. We tried to summarize our works we’ve done before, but it was not easy to make it. Reading this document will help you save time and work efficiently with the developers and other contributors.



## Development Ideology



We pursue, 

1. __The development which communicates each other.__
We think connecting each other is the most valuable development in the world. That's why we start this project.

2. __The development which shares ‘Think’ free without constraint each other.__
This is what we most importantly think. And you can find this pursuit is reflected on our project name, 'Shout-Out'.

3. __The development which shares values and interest fields each other.__
On our project, we have different categories of different fields which can share personal values and interests.



## Translations



As you know, our first vital priority is 'the development which communicates'. Translating seems that it is a small work which is optional, but it is one of the most important contributions. It is a first step for everyone to communicate and share each other. If you hope to contribute as a translater, thank you for your contribution! Now we only have Korean and English. However, please be aware of reading next sentences.
